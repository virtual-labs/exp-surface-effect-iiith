**To start the experiment do the following:**  
    
1. Prepare a 100 ml of 10-3 M AgNO3 solution and a 10 mL of 1 % trisodium citrate solution by dissolving AgNO3 and trisodium citrate, respectively, in deionized water.     
2. Take a 500 mL volume conical flask (by clicking on it) and pour 100 ml of 10-3 M AgNO3 solution into the flask.    
3.  Place the beaker on a magnetic stirrer-cum-heater.    
4.  Set the heater temperature to 100Â°C (by clicking on the Heater knob)    
5.  Place a magnetic bar into the flask and set the stirrer to a medium speed.       
6.  The solution is heated to boiling.    
7.  When water in the flask starts boiling, to this solution add 10 mL of 1 % trisodium citrate drop by drop with the help of a clean dropper. Note down your observation.    
8.  When the color change is steady, turn off the heater and stirrer and bring down the Ag colloid to the room temperature.    
9.  Collect 5 mL of the Ag colloid in a test tube from the above flask.    
10.  Add saturated HgCl2 solution dropwise to the test tube and shake the test tube gently. Note down your observation.
