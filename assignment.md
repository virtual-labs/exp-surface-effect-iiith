**Pre-Assignment**

1. If you cut a cube of 1 cm edge length into a cube of 1 micrometer edge length, how many cubes will be formed from the original cube?  
2. What will be increase in surface area after forming the smaller cubes in the above question?    
3. How does the surface area affect the reaction rate?    
4. Why do the properties of small particles differ from their bulk counterparts?  

**Post-Assignment**  
    
1. Why do you expect the citrate-stabilized sols are more stable against coagulation than borohydride-stabilized ones?     
2. How does the higher temperature (100oC) help in Ag colloid preparation?    
3. Which metal -Ag or Hg- has the higher position in the electrochemical series?    
4. Why does silver chloride precipitate appear from silver colloid upon reacting with mercuric chloride?
